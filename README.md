# Python binding for the Chemharp library

This repository contains the Python binding for the Chemharp library. This binding is
created with the ctypes module, calling directly the C interface of Chemharp, and thus
is compatible with Python 2 and 3, and with all versions of Numpy.

Provided that the C++ Chemharp library is installed, you can install this python binding
by running:

```
python setup.py install
```
